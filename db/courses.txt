Salvage, plunder, and outright piracy, armed robbery at sea, offered chances for personal advancement and a means to undermine the authority of states and potentates. Piracy was a useful tool, and ?pirate? quickly became a loaded term. This course explores who held the right to wield that label and how piracy changed throughout ancient Mediterranean history.|

We will explore the meanings and uses of music, such as the way music is used to heighten and ensure spiritual efficacy, to comment on and contribute to social movements, or to make sense of ?natural? disasters. Rather than diving deep into musical structures, we will explore music in its cultural, political, religious, economic, historical, and/or ecological contexts. Ultimately, the course gives you critical tools and frames to apply to your own case students.  |: This class is designed for students without prior musical experience. See ETHN 100 for a comparable class that requires experience.

This course introduces ethnographic research methods (i.e. fieldwork) through reading classic and contemporary ethnographies, fieldwork manuals, and direct exposure to the work of practicing ethnomusicologists who ground their own work in diverse approaches to ethnomusicological research in the 21st century. Using tools and practices from the course, students will design their own ethnographic research projects about a musical community and conduct fieldwork throughout the semester that culminates in writing a musical ethnography.  |: ETHN 100 or CMUS 103 recommended.

Engaging postconolonial theory, we?ll consider colonialist practices of engaging and coming to know the ?other,? ranging from World Fairs to sound archives and museums. The course will expose the colonialist legacies of ethnomusicology?s past enabled by the invention of the gramophone before turning our attention to decolonizing strategies and next practices, including repatriation of archival materials to their rightful owners, collaborative ethnography, and designing new, community-driven modes of knowledge production and dissemination.  Prerequisites: ETHN 100 or CMUS 103 suggested; and/or ETHN course @200 level.|

Humans can recognize past climate changes because growing glaciers scour Earth?s surface and shrinking glaciers leave characteristic deposits.  Moreover, glacial ice itself contains a detailed record of climate changes.  This course uses glacier dynamics and glacial geology to determine how climate changed in the past, analyzes Earth?s climate system to identify factors that contribute to climate change, and assesses natural and anthropogenic causes of climate change.

This upper-level seminar invites students to participate in these projects by asking: 1) What are the origins of China and why do they matter? 2) How do we (re)write history using newly discovered material and manuscript sources? 3) What is the relation between these sources and classic texts?  Emphasis will be placed on first-hand access to material objects.  No language expertise required, but original language sources will be available.  Field trip required.|

We then move to theories of morality, which work to settle which actions are right and wrong. Finally, we end by considering ethical disputes.
