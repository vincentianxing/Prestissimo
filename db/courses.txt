Emphasis is placed on transcription and creating a means of adaptation to the student's primary (western) instrument.  Ensemble instruction will be divided into two modules per semester, each focusing on the musical styles of a particular region (Sub-Saharan Africa, South America/Central America/The Caribbean, Northern Africa/The Middle East, Asia).  PI ensembles will participate in intensive residencies and collaborative performances with visiting artists.  Prerequisite & Notes:  APST 140 or 141 (Internalizing Rhythms) and APST 142 (Beginning Improvisation) or demonstrated improvisational skill.  Audition and instructor's consent required.  Students with highly proficient performance skills on a unique or indigenous instrument are also eligible to audition. PI ensembles may not be used to satisfy major ensemble requirements.|

We will focus on smaller contexts, including temples, tombs, and artistic circles and examine a range of media (e.g. painting, sculpture, prints).  Primary themes will include how socio-political circumstances inform artistic production, the spatial or social networks of art, cultural exchange, and tensions between court-sponsored traditions and other artistic practices.  |:  Cross-listed with ARTS 152.

In the histories of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, Shinto, physical things have participated in the making of religious identities by serving ceremonial and practical purposes, giving shape to doctrine, and mediating exchanges between religious communities and society. These diverse roles will be assessed in the study of a wide range of objects, including statues, silk, aromatics, scrolls, hair, robes, portraits, and relics. We seek to enliven textual accounts with perspectives from material culture and the senses, and along the way engage issues of materiality, representation, and agency.|

This course will ?look awry? at this quintessential Chinese value system through three figures who live on the margins of society: the stateless outlaw, the homeless knight-errant, and the martial assassin. Their struggle against orthodoxy enables us to consider how political legitimacy, moral norms, patriarchal structure, and elite status can be at once challenged and reproduced in the social periphery. Core texts include representative works from each time period, ranging from historical biographies in early China to contemporary Cantonese rap music.|

(xiangtu) in Chinese stands for rurality, hometown, and local culture. Since the 1920s, nativist movements in Taiwan explore, define, and debate over writings that are distinctively ?Taiwanese.? In this sense, ?native-soil? becomes a site of memory, transformation, atonement, and melancholia. Native-soil literature studied in this course articulates an individual?s relationship with home not only in terms of ?where I am from,? ?why I depart,? ?how I return,? but fundamentally, ?who I am.? This course explores Taiwanese literature produced in two literary debates in the 1920s and 1970s, as well as works by neo-native soils writers after the millennium.|

At the same time, critics within the tradition have produced trenchant critiques of human autonomy and environmental utilitarianism.  This environmental history course will introduce students to historical human ecology in continental East Asia.  Topics will include: hydraulic civilization and its discontents, ?hard? and ?soft? frontiers, ecological imperialism, the politics of landscape, and the green revolution in ?Red? China.|

How have Buddhists historically imagined the body, disease, and healing? How was this therapeutic imagination in turn shaped by morality, monasticism, ritual practice, and demonology? This course brings these questions to an examination of the rich history of Buddhist healing. Throughout, we also emphasize the intersections of Buddhist healing with other traditions known and practiced in China, Korea, and Japan, including Ayurveda, Daoism, and varieties of classical and popular medicine.|

Or did it resemble popular depictions of hell, where rulers of the underworld were depicted behind desks overflowing with files.  In this legal history course, we read broadly from exemplary scholarship, theories of law and society, and sources legal, literary and visual.

This course will investigate the aesthetics and politics of climate justice through cultural productions including literature, film, new media, performance, protest, and social movements, placing climate activism in the UK in historical context as well as within current movements such as the Arab Spring and Occupy. Through projects and wider class discussions, we will consider the intersection of aesthetics and politics in climate justice and inquire into the potential for this convergence to generate democratic forms of engagement. Field trips required.  Prerequisite: Taught in London. Prior application and acceptance to the Oberlin-in-London Program required.|

What is the nature of love? Are there reasons that justify our love for others, or does love fail to admit of such reasons? What, if anything, is the value of sex? What is the moral status of prostitution? Of procreation? Of pornography? We'll discuss all these issues and more, getting clear on what the moral concerns are and which views one might take in response to them. There are no prerequisites for this course. (V)|

This same period, however, has also tested the limits of these laws and institutions, and of the political will that lies at their foundation. The course charts this jagged progress: from the law's triumph, to its limits, in preventing and responding to atrocity. Students will learn about how laws and legal institutions developed, how these efforts reflected and pushed against global power politics, where the law reigned in atrocities, and where it failed. |: POLT 120

While we deal extensively with certain hardware and software such as Max/MSP and ProTools, the course is not ?about? said tools. Rather, it is organized around musical/scholarly practice and approaches, each of which inevitably draws on a variety of tools. All topics are approached through a combination of reading, listening, and creative work with the ultimate goal of expanding compositional resources and scholarly vocabulary. The first module focuses on stereo composition and diffusion, while the second focuses on multi-channel composition.  Prerequisite & Notes:  TECH 202.  Consent of the Instructor.|
