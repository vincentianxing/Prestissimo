Today cultural heritage is threatened worldwide from wanton damage, theft, looting, and environmental impact. Any loss of one culture?s heritage is a loss to all humanity. This course will discuss, in a series of global case studies, the challenges faced in the 21st century to create management and preservation strategies in order to protect our cultural inheritance.  |:

Unmaking the bourgeois century?s vision of women as either ?housewives or harlots,? we will consider the status of working-class women struggling to survive in a rapidly urbanizing and industrializing society. Working in teams, and collaborating with SOCI 338, students will conduct research, survey literary texts, analyze satirical prints, and translate sections of an 1836 treatise on prostitution. Conducted in French except for joint sessions with SOCI.  Prerequisite & Notes:  Two French courses beyond 301.|

Americans have long hailed innovations in media technologies as democratic spaces that expand the possibilities of inclusion even as commentators criticize popular culture for sustaining normative ideals of identity. We will address these competing trends by studying how cultural producers rely on contested concepts of gender, sexuality, race, ability and social class to navigate the politics of visibility in different media. |
