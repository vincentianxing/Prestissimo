Using the work of Michel Foucault, the course follows the evolution of animals from the Middle Ages, when beasts were represented anthropomorphically and used to convey religious symbolism, to the Renaissance and Classical Age, when animals were freed from religious allegory and roamed wild as figures of freedom and madness in literature and art, but later defined as machines by Descartes and confined in the first modern zoo at Versailles.   | Prerequisite: Two 300-level courses beyond 301.

The writings of the Lumieres produced an intellectual revolution that elaborated a consciousness of the Other previously excluded by race, geographical origin, gender identity, social status, etc. This course will use eighteenth-century French texts (Diderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and others) to appraise this construction of a theory of acceptance of the Other, and how this design played a role in the French Revolution.

Advancing ice sculpts Earth's surface, whereas retreating ice deposits rock debris. Moreover, the ice in glaciers contains a detailed record of climate changes. This course uses glacier dynamics and glacial geology to examine the factors that control climate change, to determine how climate changed in the past, and to analyze natural and anthropogenic causes of climate change. To earn quantitative proficiency, students must complete six problems sets. Enrollment Limit: 60.  |

Emphasis is placed on analytical skills applicable to performance. The first module focuses on metric hierarchy in tonal music. Topics include the distinction between grouping and meter, hypermeter, metric dissonance/resolution, and the relation between metric and tonal hierarchies. The second module covers contemporary and world-music repertoires, and focuses on non-hierarchical metric structures. Topics include irregular pulses, stable polymeters, phase shifts, mensural theories, and simple mathematical models.   |  Prerequisite: MUTH 232.  Consent of the instructor required.

Faced with an oppressive political system, overwhelming evidence of suffering, poverty, and appalling ignorance,  the imperfectability of human nature and the messiness of personal relationships, and, finally, the specter of death, Russian writers had ample opportunity to ponder the meaning ? and meaningless ? of existence.  Their attempts to grapple with the ?cursed questions? of life gave rise to an extraordinarily rich existentialist tradition.  Drawing on classic works by Pushkin, Gogol, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov and others, the course will take a sane, upbeat, and irreverent approach to some timeless and very serious issues.    |
