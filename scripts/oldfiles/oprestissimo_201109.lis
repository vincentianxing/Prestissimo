We will examine their major differences at the time of European contact, ways colonialism differently transformed their cultures, and how and where the original population may have originated and dispersed.|

In instrumental concerts today, symphonies hold pride of place: they usually occur by themselves during the second half, while other works are often relegated to the first half of the concert, serving as a warm-up. This was not always the case, and this seminar seeks to investigate how the symphony went from a 'curtain raiser' genre, less important than concertos and vocal selections, to the center of the European and North American musical canon.  |

Our investigation of satire will focus on the question of how satire works both negatively, as a critique of social ills, and positively, to supply, however indirectly, solutions to the problems it delights in exposing.

What are the challenges of trying to do both? The exploration of these questions, based on the Mayor?s experience and an original case study of his Administration, is framed by a consideration of what has been and remains the fundamental issue of American political life: What should government do? (And not do?) The final paper assignment asks of students: ?If you had been the Mayor, how would you have attempted to reconcile the making of good public policy with a successful re-election campaign??|
