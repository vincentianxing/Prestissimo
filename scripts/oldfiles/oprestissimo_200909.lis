We will examine some of the biases that we bring to our reasoning about the world and the methods that psychological scientists use to eliminate biases in data collection, interpretation, and knowledge construction.  We will be designing experiments, collecting data, interpreting findings, writing reports, and presenting results in class.  Enrollment Limit: 14|
