This course will research the history, science, politics and legal maneuvering of this particular conflict between science and religion. We will explore the structure of scientific research and methods, what distinguishes science from pseudoscience, the history of the creationist and intelligent design movements, and how the two sides in this debate are often talking past each other, with little common ground. |

Yet history has shown just how precarious that status can be. The concept of the ?rights-bearing individual? emerged in 17th century Europe along with trans-Atlantic slavery and the denial of the humanity of the vast majority of the world?s colonized people.  In this seminar, we will examine the historically contextualized notion of human rights as we explore the surprisingly tenuous concept of who is ?human? and what are ?rights.?  |

To be able to talk coherently about these concepts, we will discuss precise mathematical notions of symmetry, and we will explore the rich world this mathematics opens up.|

Can natural selection favor cooperation in non-human animals in spite of their 'selfish genes'? Perhaps so, but can evolutionary theory account for elaborate social phenomena that seem restricted to humans - for example, religion, economic exchange and political alliances?
