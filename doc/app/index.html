<hr>

<p>If you have no idea what any of these Prestissimo files do/mean, you are
probably new to rails. You should do this tutorial. THE WHOLE THING.
Don&#39;t get lazy half way through and stop doing it because you will
still be lost. I MEAN IT.</p>

<p><a
href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book</a></p>

<p>It is quite comprehensive and will teach you (most) everything you will
need to know to work on Prestissimo. It doesn&#39;t go much into javascript
so you might need to do some more research on that if need be.</p>

<p>You will need to have at least a cursory understanding of Ruby–I recommend
Why&#39;s Poignant Guide to Ruby, at <a
href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide">mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide</a>/.
It&#39;s a little verbose, but it&#39;s a fun read. Just doing the first
couple chapters will give you a good enough idea of things.</p>

<p>You will need to know some html, css, and javascript/jquery. Good tutorials
for all of these can be found on <a
href="www.w3schools.com/.">www.w3schools.com/.</a> If you haven&#39;t done
any web development in the past, I suggest doing these tutorials as well.
They&#39;re pretty short and really helpful. A more complete HTML, JS, and
CSS reference can be found at the Mozilla Developer Network, <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US">developer.mozilla.org/en-US</a>/,
and a complete technical book on modern Javascript can be found at <a
href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html">eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html</a>,
though this goes into much deeper detail than is perhaps neeed. Finally,
Prestissimo makes heavy use of the jQuery Javascript library, whose
extensive documentation can be found at <a
href="http://api.jquery.com">api.jquery.com</a>/.</p>

<h3 id="label-2.+New+to+Git-3F">2. New to Git?<span><a href="#label-2.+New+to+Git-3F">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<hr>

<p>Git is the version control system that Prestissimo uses. The rails tutorial
above uses git, so after going through that you should have a pretty good
grasp on the major features.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind that whenever you make changes to Prestissimo, you&#39;ll
want to commit them. Update first, make changes, then commit. Commit early,
commit often. AND WRITE GOOD COMMIT MESSAGES.</p>

<p>The online git repo is kept on Gitlab at <a
href="https://gitlab.com/mmitchel1/prestissimo">gitlab.com/mmitchel1/prestissimo</a>
While the new site is in development, <strong>Make sure you are using the
newprestissimo branch.</strong> We do not want to overwrite the old code
until we are sure the new code works.</p>

<p>To clone the repo, you need two things: access to it on GitLab, and a
GitLab account with an  ssh key <em>from your account on the Prestissimo
server</em>. If you don&#39;t know how to do the  second part, check this
out <a
href="https://dev.to/sndrx/how-to-set-up-an-ssh-key-and-use-it-in-gitlab--42p1">dev.to/sndrx/how-to-set-up-an-ssh-key-and-use-it-in-gitlab–42p1</a>
Also check this out for ssh generation and permissions <a
href="https://gist.github.com/grenade/6318301">gist.github.com/grenade/6318301</a>
Once you&#39;ve done both things, you can clone with</p>

<pre>$ git clone git@gitlab.com:mmitchel1/prestissimo.git</pre>

<p>Also, make sure the project is located in /home/USERNAME/prestissimo. Some
of the scripts depend on that path. Once you&#39;ve cloned your own copy,
run <code>$ ./scrips/rcs_setup</code> to setup some of the database files,
and then ask somebody for the .secret file. The website won&#39;t work 
without it.</p>

<p>When using git, everytime you do anything, you should be creating a new
branch. <strong>Never</strong> edit and commit to the main branch. Always
make a new branch, edit, commit, then merge ONLY after making sure
everything works perfectly. And if you&#39;re on one branch for a while,
make sure to keep it up to date with master using <code>$ git
rebase</code>. That way, you&#39;ll be able to fix any issues you have with
someone else&#39;s merge <strong>before</strong> the bug gets to master.</p>

<hr>

<p>Normally, prestissimo lives in three locations:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>oprestissimo.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>oprestissimo.info</p>
</li><li>
<p>Your Home Directory (on oprestissimo.info)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>However, while under development, there is no oprestissimo.com or
oprestissimo.info.  Right now, <strong>it is just on the new Ubuntu server
at 132.162.201.242</strong>, and in your home directory.</p>

<p><strong>oprestissimo.com</strong> will be the production server. The files
for the real Prestissimo, the files that are running the whole shebang,
will be located in: /var/www/html/oprestissimo.com/ DON&#39;T TOUCH THEM.
EVER. When you need to make changes to the production website, there is a
script that will do everything without any human intervention. Read more
about this in section 7, <em>Procedure for making changes to the
website</em>.</p>

<p><strong>oprestissimo.info</strong> will be the development server. Most of
the time you will be logged into this server. This is also a public
website, but no one knows about it (<a
href="https://oprestissimo.info">oprestissimo.info</a>). You should be
testing any changes you make with the oprestissimo.info server. A copy of
prestissimo will also be located on this server in the same location as
above.</p>

<p><strong>Your Home Directory (on oprestissimo.info)</strong>: there should
be a copy of prestissimo in your home directory. If there isn&#39;t, you
can clone one (see above section). ALL THE CHANGES YOU EVER MAKE TO THE
WEBSITE WILL HAPPEN HERE. There are scipts that will automatically push
your changes to the development server and later the production server.</p>

<h3 id="label-4.+Connecting+to+Prestissimo-2Frails+server">4. Connecting to Prestissimo/rails server<span><a href="#label-4.+Connecting+to+Prestissimo-2Frails+server">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<hr>

<p>This part can be a bit confusing at first because of Oberlin&#39;s
firewalls. First of all, you can only access any Prestissimo server through
the Oberlin VPN. If you don&#39;t know how to use the Oberlin VPN, check
this out <a
href="https://citwiki.oberlin.edu/index.php/VPN">citwiki.oberlin.edu/index.php/VPN</a></p>

<p>If you have been reading up on Ruby on Rails, you know about <code>$ rails
server</code>. This is what you&#39;ll be using to view your changes in
your home directory version of prestissimo as you are making them.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll need to specify a port number when you start up rails server.
You can type <code>$ rails s -p &lt;port #&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Some things to keep in mind with port numbers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>you might have to try a couple different ports before you get a free one</p>
</li><li>
<p>Oberlin blocks ports that aren&#39;t between 3000-3100, so use something
like 3005</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Viewing changes with rails server</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Make sure you are on the Oberlin VPN.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To see your rails server, navigate to
<code>http://132.162.201.242:3005</code> (note that you DO NOT connect with
https. 3005 is just a placeholder port, you&#39;ll want to navigate to the
port that you specified with rails server -p &lt;port&gt;).</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<h3 id="label-5.+Editing+files+on+the+Prestissimo+server">5. Editing files on the Prestissimo server<span><a href="#label-5.+Editing+files+on+the+Prestissimo+server">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<hr>

<p>To edit any files on the server you can use vim or emacs, but we&#39;ve
also set it up so you can use Visual Studio Code to remotely make changes.
If you  don&#39;t have it downloaded, you can get it here <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">code.visualstudio.com/download</a>
Getting it working with Prestissimo is easy:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Make sure VS Code works on your machine.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using the built in Extensions Manager, install the <strong>Remote -
SSH</strong> extension.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure you are on the Oberlin VPN.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When you reload VS Code, you&#39;ll see a little green buton with two
arrows at  the bottom left of the window. Click it. Then select &#39;Remote
- SSH: Connect to Host…&#39;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter your ssh login, ie user@132.162.201.242 (and password if you
haven&#39;t shared your public key with  Prestissimo, which you should),
and it should just work!</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once you&#39;re in, install the &#39;Ruby&#39; and &#39;GitLens&#39;
extensions if they aren&#39;t  already installed and reload VS Code.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>If any of that gives you trouble, just Google whatever didn&#39;t work.
There are a lot  of good answers on the web.</p>

<h3 id="label-6.+How+do+I+figure+out+what+the+heck+is+going+on+here-3F-3F">6. How do I figure out what the heck is going on here??<span><a href="#label-6.+How+do+I+figure+out+what+the+heck+is+going+on+here-3F-3F">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<hr>

<p>The answer is simple: DOCUMENTATION.</p>

<p>Documentation is a very important part of any large piece of software. VERY
IMPORTANT. As you are learning how Prestissimo works, refer to its
documentation to gain a better understanding. As you add new things, add
new documentation. This mostly amounts to being careful about commenting
your code.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p>Where is Prestissimo&#39;s documentation? To find Prestissimo&#39;s
documentation, you can navigate to oprestissimo.info/app/index.html. This
takes you to the pretty browser based interface for exploring
Prestissimo&#39;s soure code. You should find lots of useful information
about all the controllers, models, helpers and libraries.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When should I write more documentation? If you add any new controllers,
models, or helpers or add new methods to an existing
controller/model/helper, you should write a sentence or two about what it
does, what parameters it takes in, what it returns, where is the method
being called, what views correspond to which controllers, etc. You can
write this directly in the code, above the
method/controller/helper/whatever.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How do I write more documentation? The documentation is all written using
rdoc style comments. Here is a short guide to writing the documentation: <a
href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Markup.html">rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Markup.html</a>
Think of it as javadocs.</p>

<p>To recompile the documentation, you simply type: <code>$ rake
doc:app</code></p>

<p>This reparses all of the docs and rebuilds the nice html pages in 
oprestissimo.info/app/index.html. The html pages are all in doc/app/</p>

<p>Recompile your docs often and make sure they look the way they should look–
rdoc sometimes doesn&#39;t do what you want it to do.</p>
</li></ol>

<h3 id="label-7.+Procedure+for+making+changes+to+the+website">7. Procedure for making changes to the website<span><a href="#label-7.+Procedure+for+making+changes+to+the+website">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<hr>

<p>Okay, so you&#39;ve made some changes in your home directory Prestissimo
and you think they&#39;re ready to get pushed up to the production site.
Follow these steps to proceed:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>DOCUMENT THE CHANGES THAT YOU HAVE MADE</strong>. Read more about
this in the previous section. Don&#39;t forget to compile the docs with
<code>$ rake doc:app</code> before you commit!</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure you have committed <strong>and pushed</strong> all of your
changes to the git repository. Make sure git doesn&#39;t think you&#39;ve
modified any of the database files (especially courses.txt), only ruby on
rails files. If it is necessary to modify the database files (files
contained in db/), be very very careful and make sure you fully understand
all of the scripts that update the database.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In your home directory version of prestissimo, run  <code> $ sudo
./scripts/fixit </code> (If you don&#39;t have sudo permissions, you should
get someone to give you sudo permission.) You can read the script to see
what it does, but basically it does an git pull in the main website folder
and migrates the database.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Check to make sure your changes are working well on the live site. Once you
are happy with the way it&#39;s working, and you&#39;ve decided that
it&#39;s time to update the production server, you can proceed to the next
step. <strong>Except don&#39;t actually, stop here. The rest doesn&#39;t
work right now.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>ssh to the oprestissimo.com server. Your login should be the same as the
.info server</p>
</li><li>
<p>back up the database by cd&#39;ing into db and running  <code> $ sudo
./dump_db </code></p>
</li><li>
<p>sudo to the apache user:  <code> $ sudo -s -u apache </code></p>
</li><li>
<p>If you need any gems to be updated you will also need to uncomment the
section  of comfixit that runs “bundle update” and, the first time you do
this, you should talk to professor Hoyle about giving the apache user
privileges to use sudo without a password. He&#39;ll show you how to do so
in the future. When you&#39;re done, don&#39;t forget to recomment the
section!</p>
</li><li>
<p>You are now ready to run  <code> $ ./comfixit </code> After running
./comfixit, the oprestissimo.com website should have your changes on it. 
If things go awry, there are READMEs that will tell you how to roll back
the database in the doc directory.</p>
</li></ol>

<h3 id="label-8.+The+Database">8. The Database<span><a href="#label-8.+The+Database">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<hr>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>
<p><em>About the database</em></p>

<p>The database, as you can probably guess, holds information about all the
courses, users, carts, comments, and much more. There are various READMEs
in the doc/ directory that will explain more about the structure of the
database and how to update or  rollback the database.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Examining the database by hand</em></p>

<p>The database is a MySql database. If you need to log in to the database,
you can do so by typing:</p>

<pre>$ sudo mysql -u busystudent -p</pre>

<p>It will then prompt you for a password. If you need the password, ask
somebody in charge. The username is busystudent.</p>

<p>However, I would recommend accessing the database through rails console.
It&#39;s like directly accessing the database, but instead of doing it with
sql statements, you can use Ruby on Rails code.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Updating the courses in the database</em></p>

<p>The courses in the database get updated with the scripts/data_pull script.
Basically, we get a file from CIT, which goes into /home/datadump. This
file is  sent four times a day, every weekeday. To see the exact times,
check the crontab for root. scripts/data_pull checks the time stamp on this
file to see if we have received a new one, and if so, first does a sanity
check on the file, then creates a file called courses.txt  in the db
directory (btw, don&#39;t ever manually edit this file, it could wreak
havoc on the database). That file then gets parsed and fed into the
database with the rake task update_courses (located in
./lib/tasks/update_courses.rake). To gain a better understanding of what
happens, read through the scripts – the process is a little more involved
than what I just described.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Backing up the database </em></p>

<p>There are helpful READMEs in the /doc directory that explain more about the
database.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Who should we contact in CIT if we have problems?</em></p>

<p><em>How do courses get updated between semesters?</em></p>

<p>A new file is automatically sent at the start of each semester.  The
scripts that parse the file will be able to automatically tell that it is
for a new semester and will create new courses for all of the courses in
the new semester. It will update the value for &#39;current_semester&#39;
and add a new option on the front page for semester. Basically, the whole
process is entirely automated, as long as the file for the new semester is
in EXACTLY the same format as the file for the old semester.</p>

<p><em>How do I set an admin?</em></p>

<p>Admins can be set by other admins on the website under Account/Admin/Edit
Global Settings, or by changing the user&#39;s admin column in the database
to 1.</p>

<pre>$ update users set admin=1 where email=&quot;flast@oberlin.edu&quot;</pre>
</li></ol>

<p>Oprestissimo uses Apache to host its webserver. If you need to edit any of
the apache settings, you can find them at</p>

<pre>/etc/apache2/sites-available/oprestissimo.com.conf</pre>

<p>To work with Rails, we are using the Passenger module. It is very easy to
use. To tell it to use a specific version of Ruby you need to:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Set the Ruby version with</p>

<pre>$ rvm use VERSION</pre>

<p>To see all available Ruby versions, use</p>

<pre>$ rvm list</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure Passenger is using the right version of Ruby with</p>

<pre>$ passenger-config about ruby-command</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Edit the PassengerRuby line in the Apache conf file above to reflect the
changes to the Ruby version.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>To restart the server, use</p>

<pre>$ sudo systemctl restart apache2.service</pre>
