    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <p>The Settings page allows users to modify their account settings and restrict the publicity of their profile information. To find the page click on the settings link in the "Account" dropdown menu at the top of the page. Click the 'update commenter name' button to update your commenter name and the 'save changes' button at the bottom of the page to save the rest of the changes.</p>
    <ul class="bulletlist">
      <li>The <strong>Commenter Name</strong> is an automatically generated handle that acts as a username for your comments. To change your handle, just enter in a new title that will continue to preserve your anonymity, and click the Update button. Please read the Site Usage portion of our <%=link_to "Community Guidelines Page", guidelines_path %> to clarify any questions concerning commenter names.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Profile Page Settings</strong> are as follows:</li>
      <ul class="bulletlist2">
        <li><strong>Nickname:</strong> If given, this will replace the "Profile" title on the top of a User Profile page. </li>
        <li><strong>Year:</strong> This could be your current year at Oberlin, your graduation year, or the year you first arrived at Oberlin. It is open to interpretation!</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Info:</strong> This is a box where you may write essentially anything about yourself that fits within Prestissimo's community guidelines.</li>
        <li>To hide a Profile page field from public view, click the associated checkbox and save.</li>
