<h2>For Students and Staff:</h2>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>The Settings page allows users to modify their account settings and restrict the publicity of their profile information.

  <li>The <strong>Commenter Name</strong> is an automatically generated handle that acts as a username for your comments. To change your handle, just enter in a new title that will continue to preserve your anonymity, and click the Update button. Please read the Site Usage portion of our <%=link_to "Community Guidelines Page", guidelines_path %> to clarify any questions concerning commenter names.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Profile Page Settings</strong> are as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nickname:</strong> If given, this will replace the "Profile" title on the top of a User Profile page. </li>
    <li><strong>Year:</strong> This could be your current year at Oberlin, your graduation year, or the year you first arrived at Oberlin. It is open to interpretation!</li>
    <li><strong>Profile Info:</strong> This is a box where you may write essentially anything about yourself that fits within Prestissimo's community guidelines.</li>
    <li>To hide a Profile page field from public view, click the associated checkbox and save.</li>
