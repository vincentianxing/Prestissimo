<h1>Search Results Help</h1>
<p>Course results contain a lot of information that can be found by clicking on the result. Read on for help understanding what everything means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>When you enter a search query, a list of courses that correspond to your search will appear below the search fields. These courses are listed in alphabetical order by deparment, and then numerically by course number. If a course is already in your cart, the course will be green. If a course conflicts with a course in your cart, the text will be grayed out and the meeting times that conflict will be in red. <strong>Don't worry!</strong> You can still add conflicting courses to your cart. In each row of the results table, you will see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A checkbox that allows you to select the course and add it to your cart using the buttons above or below the search results</li>
  <li>The CRN (Course Registration Number). You can use this number to find the course on PRESTO when you are registering for classes. Sometimes, classes with multiple sections or labs will be listed individually and will have different CRNs.</li>
  <li>An abbreviated department that the class is offered in.</li>
  <li>The course number.</li>
  <li>A possibly abbreviated course title.</li>
  <li>Course professor(s).</li>
  <li>Course meeting days. "T" is used to denote Tuesday, while "R" denotes Thursday.</li>
  <li>Course meeting times. Courses may have multiple times listed. This may mean the course has an associated lab or meeting group.</li>
  <li>Building and room number.</li>
  <li>Current enrollment. The top number is how many people are enrolled in the class, and the bottom is the maximum number that the class can have. Keep in mind that this information is updated daily and may not be precisely accurate - check with <a href="http://presto.cc.oberlin.edu">PRESTO</a> or the course instructor for more accurate information. When 20% or less seats remain in the class, the top number will be red.</li>
