<h1>The Course Cart</h1>
<p>
The course cart is a Prestissimo feature accessible to anyone who visits the website. Think of it as a shopping cart for classes: you can add or remove classes to it, or email it to yourself to streamline your course registration process. Check out our tips below on how to use the cart to its full potential!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Do I Use the Course Cart?</h2>
<p>To add a new course to your cart, simply do a course search, click the checkbox of any classes you would like to add, and click one of the <strong>"Add to Cart"</strong> buttons at the top and bottom of your results. To remove a course, click the <strong>"[X]"</strong> on the class you would like to delete from the cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What If I Built My Cart Before Signing In?</h2>
<p>Never fear! If a cart is constructed before you sign in, when you attempt to sign in, you will be asked if you would like to combine your current cart with your user account cart. Conflicting courses will still show up in your cart.</p>
