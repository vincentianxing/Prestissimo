A dual focus on sociology (the musicians, their roles, their audience) and musicology (the instruments, elements of style, and compositional principles) is pursued through a field project, aural analysis, transcription, and in-class performance. Enrollment Limit: 40.   |  For a similar course assuming no music knowledge see CMUS 103.
