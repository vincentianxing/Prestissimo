In this course we will examine the extent to which this idealization offers an appropriate interpretation of scientific practice. |

Starting from basic embodied experience, this course explores how music generates affect -how and why different works and styles have different feels-and how the experience and feel of music motivate and ground traditional and novel concepts. The approach is interdisciplinary, with readings drawn from: perception and cognition (general and musical); ancient and modern philosophy and music theory; human development (ontogenetic and phylogenetic); cognitive neuroscience; cognitive linguistics; and musicology, including gender issues pertaining to music. Written coursework includes 1) responses to readings, 2) brief analyses of works and styles, and 3) a term paper.    |  Prerequisites: Junior standing and instructor consent.
