Drawing on an eclectic range of scholarly and activist work, this seminar explores the emergence and spread of consumerism, interrogates the ?overconsumption? it is thought to create, and considers the politics and policy requirements of material sacrifice in service of environmental sustainability.  The seminar requires close reading of text, analytic writing, and engaged discussion.   Prerequisite & Notes:  ENVS 101 or Consent|

Students will design and construct models as a means of building understanding of a variety of biological, physical, social and environmental phenomena.  Models developed will cover topics ranging from physiology to community dynamics to large-scale flows of material and energy.  These examples will provide students with systems-thinking skills and a library of analogies that can be broadly applied to problems in the natural and social sciences.  Credit can be counted towards either biology or environmental studies majors.  Prerequisites:  BIOL 120 or BIOL 102, at least one college chemistry course, comfort using algebraic equations.    |  Credit can be counted towards either biology or environmental studies majors.

Faced with an oppressive political system, overwhelming evidence of suffering, poverty, and appalling ignorance,  the imperfectability of human nature and the messiness of personal relationships, and, finally, the specter of death, Russian writers had ample opportunity to ponder the meaning ? and meaningless ? of existence.  Their attempts to grapple with the ?cursed questions? of life gave rise to an extraordinarily rich existentialist tradition.  Drawing on classic works by Pushkin, Gogol, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov and others, the course will take a sane, upbeat, and irreverent approach to some timeless and very serious issues.    |
