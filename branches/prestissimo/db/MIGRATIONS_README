THIS IS HOW TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE DATABASE

1) To make any kind of change to the database, first you'll need to run the command:

   rails generate migration [MigrationName]

There is a special command to generate the code in the migration file for adding a column to the table:

   rails generate migration add_fieldname_to_tablename fieldname:datatype

2) The above command generated a migration file db/migrate/timestamp_migration_name
       (or db/migrate/timestamp_add_fieldname_to_tablename in the special case)

If you ran the special case, unless you want to make more specific changes, move to step 3.

Open the migration file. here will be two methods defined: up and down. Up should make the changes you want, while down should undo them.

To see the possible migration actions in rails, direct to: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html.

3) Once the migration file is configured, run the command:

   rake db:migrate

Now the database should reflect the changes specified in the up method of your migration.
