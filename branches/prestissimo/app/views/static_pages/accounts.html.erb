<h1>User Accounts</h1>
<p>
If you are a student, faculty member, or employee of Oberlin college, you are entitled to a user account on this website! This help page focuses on how to set up your account, how to change your account settings, and the extra features available to a signed in user.
</p>

<h2>Why Should I Set Up a User Account?</h2>
<p>As an anonymous user of Prestissimo, you will have access to the course search and the <%= link_to "course cart", help_cart_path %> giving you all the necessary tools to create your own schedule. However, many more helpful features and pages will be unlocked once you create your own account:</p>
<ul class="help_list" id="account_reasons">
  <li>Set up a user profile page with information about yourself!</li>
  <li>View specific professor, department, and class pages.</li>
  <li>Receive a comment handle and comment on past classes you've taken and professors who've taught you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="help_header">Creating an Account</h2>
<ol id="account_steps">
  <li>Click the <%=link_to "Sign In", signin_path %> link located under the right side of the site logo.</li>
  <li>Enter your ObieID e.g. Marvin Krislov's ObieID would be 'mkrislov.'</li>
  <li>Enter a password that's at least 6 characters long. This does not have to be your OCMail password.</li>
  <li>Click "Create My Account."</li>
  <li>You should receive an email with the subject line "do_not_reply." Open it and follow the link included to activate your account!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Signing In</h2>
<p>To sign in, follow the <%=link_to "Sign In", signin_path %> link located under the right side of the site logo. Enter your Oberlin email (ObieID@oberlin.edu) and your password. Note that email addresses formatted as 'First.Last@oberlin.edu' <i>will not let you sign in!</i> They must have the format 'flast@oberlin.edu', where 'f' is the first letter of your first name and 'last' is the first 7 letters of your last name.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The Settings page allows users to modify their account settings and restrict the publicity of their profile information. To find the page click on the settings link in the "Account" dropdown menu at the top of the page. In order to save any changes to your profile, you must enter your current password in the "old password" field at the top of the page, then click the Save button at the bottom of the page. There are 3 separate sections of the Settings page: Commenter Name, Profile Page Settings, and Password Change.</p>
<ul class="help_list">
  <li>The <strong>Commenter Name</strong> is an automatically generated handle that acts as a username for your comments. To change your handle, just enter in a new title that will continue to preserve your anonymity, and click the Update button. Please read the <span class="help_sub_list">Site Usage</span> portion of our <%=link_to "Community Guidelines Page", guidelines_path %> to clarify any questions concerning commenter names.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Profile Page Settings</strong> are as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nickname:</strong> If given, this will replace the "Profile" title on the top of a User Profile page. </li>
    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> <%= link_to "Click to Learn More", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", target: :blank  %></li>
    <li><strong>Year:</strong>This could be your current year at Oberlin, your graduation year, or the year you first arrived at Oberlin. It is open to interpretation!</li>
    <li><strong>Profile Info:</strong> This is a box where you may write essentially anything about yourself that fits within Prestissimo's community guidelines.</li>
    <li>To hide a Profile page field from public view, click the associated checkbox and save.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <strong>Password Change</strong> setting is at the bottom of the page. Simply enter a new password that is at least 6 characters long, retype the password, and save after entering your old password at the top of the page. You will receive an email notification of your password change.</li>
</ul>
