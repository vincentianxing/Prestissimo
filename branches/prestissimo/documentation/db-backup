HOW-TO Restore the database from backups

About:
  
  The database is regularly backedup using cron and mysqldump into db/backups/.
Should the database be corrupted in some way, it can be rolled back and 
re-imported from the backups. On a rollback, the specified tables will be dumped
and then imported from the backup.

Rolling Back to Last Dump:
  execute 'db/rollback' to dump and import ALL tables
  execute 'db/rollback [tablename]' to dump and import the specified table
